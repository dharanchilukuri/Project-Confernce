                        represented IEEE.<br><br>

                        As the Dean at CSU Northridge, Ramesh forged a strong relationship between the college and
                        the professional engineering community through innovative programs such as Tech Fest, and
                        the annual Senior Design Project Showcase. His efforts strengthened the pipeline and helped
                        students explore their career options while encouraging academic excellence. As dean, Dr.
                        Ramesh recruited over 35 new faculty members and led active interdisciplinary centers in
                        Energy Research, Entrepreneurship and Innovation. He helped build a robust industry advisory
                        board at the college level and active industry liaison councils at the program level. This
                        has led to several productive partnerships benefiting students and faculty.<br><br>

                        Among the unique interdisciplinary programs that he helped develop at CSUN is a Master’s
                        degree program in Assistive Technology Engineering. Graduates from the program help design
                        and create products to serve persons with disabilities. Enrollment in the college’s programs
                        more than doubled during his tenure and continues to grow with over 4,900 students in five
                        departments. He led the college and its programs through two successful ABET accreditation
                        visits in 2007 and 2013. Ramesh is an ardent advocate of student success and is the PI of a
                        nationally acclaimed five year, $ 5.5 Million grant from the US Department of Education’s
                        HSI-STEM program entitled AIMS2 to support and graduate underrepresented minorities in
                        engineering and computer science. This program was selected for sequel funding with a $ 6
                        Million grant from USDE in 2016 also under Dr. Ramesh’s leadership as the Director and Lead
                        Principal Investigator. The program was recognized with an Honorable mention by Excelencia
                        in Education in September 2014, and was a finalist for baccalaureate program of the year in
                        2018. Also in 2018, the program was one of ten programs worldwide that was shortlisted for
                        the Global Engineering Deans Council Diversity Award sponsored by Airbus. In 2014 Ramesh was
                        invited by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to host one of the
                        four national White House STEM workshops at CSU Northridge. This very successful workshop
                        was held at CSUN on October 7, 2014 and attracted leaders from academia, government, and
                        industry to discuss efforts to broaden participation in the STEM disciplines, remove
                        barriers, and improve student graduation rates- especially in engineering and computer
                        science.<br><br>
